          <p class="bold">Small to Midsized Business Telecommunications Experts for Central New England</p>

          <p>Small to midsized business telephone systems are what we're all about. For over 20 years, we've been installing and servicing a wide range of business telephone systems designed specifically to handle the needs of small businesses just like yours throughout Central New England.</p>

          <p class="bold">Small to midsized business experience and expertise.</p>

          <p>As small to midsized business telecommunications experts, we bring a lot to the table. Unlike the big, impersonal telephone companies, we work hard to develop a close relationship with our customers. We get to know their businesses so we can help them make informed, effective, cost-efficient decisions about their telecommunications systems and service. </p>

          <p class="bold">Small to midsized businesses can have big needs.</p>

          <p>We know that a small to midsized business needs to make every penny count. But just because you run a small business doesn't mean you don't have big needs. In fact, small businesses often demand the most from their telephone systems. </p>

          <p>As a small to midsized business owner, you need to do more with less. The equipment you use to run your business needs to be flexible, adaptable, cost-efficient, and long-lasting -- you don't have the luxury of being able to buy the newest gadget every year.</p>

          <p class="bold">We'll show you the best way to invest in a quality phone system that will last.</p>

          <p>A business telephone system is a major investment. That's why it's important to rely upon an experienced telecommunications expert who understands small business to provide you with the best advice and best selection to meet your specific needs. </p>

          <p class="bold">Service to fit your schedule, not ours.</p>

          <p>Our service doesn't stop after installing a business telephone system. We're here 24/7 to make sure your telephone system keeps you connected to your customers. Our expert technicians are trained to solve any problem you might encounter quickly and efficiently â€“ no run-arounds, finger-pointing, or unnecessary delays.

          <p class="bold">By signing below you are agreeing to this plan and payment structure. As the project moves forward third party contracts will be provided as defined by those vendors.</p>

          <p>Depending on the scope and involvement of so many vendors, the actual time to complete the project may be somewhat less or somewhat more than the inital estimate. During the project if there are any issues that cause significant variance in the above estimate, we will notify you as soon as possible. Adding additional tasks will likely change the cost in hardware, software licenses and labor. By signing this section, you agree to accept this proposal and the provisions of this document. Payment or lease agreement will be provided upon acceptance of this agreement.</p>
